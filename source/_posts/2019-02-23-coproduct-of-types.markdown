Coproduct

Coproduct is undervalued. It doesn't have a lot of attention like product of types does.
Product of types is present in all languages. Coproduct is present in rudimentary forms
like unions in c or enums in java none of which reflects the full power of coproduct.

Mathematical explanation of coproduct. Roots in category theory. Lecture by Bartosz Milewsky openned my eyes.
Coproduct is dual to product. It must be as important because product of types is ubiquitous.

People work with coproduct very often, but they don't realize it.

Example of coproduct in Java.

Example of coproduct in Go.

Coproduct in Haskell.
