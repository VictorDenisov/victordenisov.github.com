I started my long path into the world of computing in norton commander. Then I
worked in windows 3.11 and windows 95 all windows through windows 2003, windows
xp. In parallel I was introduced to linux. Initially the only interface I saw
in Linux was pico commander. Then all the descendants of xwindow system showed
up - gnome, kde.

The evolution of interfaces that I learned was from command line to graphical
interface. The introduction of graphical interface seemed to be progress. It
looked like After that introduction of touch screen interfaces that came with
the advent of iphone era produced even more confusion. Around that time I
graduated from university and started working in enterprise as a java
programmer.

During my 5 years at the university I participated in ICPC. ICPC is an
international competition in programming. You have three people behind one
computer and 8-12 programming problems to solve. First two years we were
programming in Pascal. Third year we programmed in C++ and then moved to Java
and eclipse as an IDE. Java seemed like progress. Intelligent autocompletion in
Eclipse completely blew my mind. Most of the time we weren't typing - we were
tapping ctrl-space and the IDE seemed to have been writing code for us. Every
winter and summer we used to go to programming camps in Petrozavodsk. To one of
those camps a team from Poland was invited. They were very strong and they were
programming C++ in ... Vim. This discovery completely threw me off. It was
completely unclear to me why they would use Vim. Vim seemed to be something
ancient, completely unfit for our twenty first century. I never bothered to
spend too much time researching this phenomenon, but it definitely struck me,
and I had remembered it.

So, when I went to enterprise I was completely confident that I used the most
advanced technologies for programming. After a couple of years in the industry
I don't know how, but I got interested in Vim. I tried it just because there
were rumours that all cool kids know Vim. So I was merely playing with Vim
until I attended a talk by one of our colleagues - Kirill Ishanov. His
introduction to Vim flipped my world. At that time I hadn't realized all
ramifications of my discovery. Now I can tell you what impressed me - Vim was
an interpreter of text editing language. Every keystroke in command mode is an instruction
in this language. If you want to can put those instructions in a register and
execute this batch. It's called macros. You can record macros by entering commands
and specifying what register you want to store them in or you can just copy and
a sequence of letters into this register. Then the whole program can be replayed from this register.
That was the moment when I became an ideological proponent of vim. Vim wasn't
just an editor. It was an interactive text processor.

Now, getting back to java programming language. At the time of programming in
java I was under impression that all languages should be or are like java -
some variation of c like syntax. Imperative in its nature. It seemed like it
was normal to write some code in an editor, then it would be compiled and
executed. Another thing was execution. We used far manager(clone of Norton
Commander) to run our apps. We rarely typed commands in the command line.
Command line seemed like something old fashioned. We didn't see point to use
it. We started using it only because it was the only way to communicate to a
remote computer over ssh. We didn't like it. It seemed like a limitation of
our abilities. I had had this attitude for command line until I visited US for the first time.
Engineers at the US office were programming in vim and were using command like
like it was their editor for entering small programs.

This topic has been bothering me since I was introduced
