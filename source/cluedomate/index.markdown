CluedoMate is a helper android application for Cluedo board game. It allows you
to make notes about what suggestions were made during the game as well as do
automatic inferences.

Current version of CluedoMate has only one set of card with fixed names.
It will be changed in future versions.

Planned features:

* show list of cards suggested by other players,
* configurable card set.

## Demo Version

Please note that there is demo version of CluedoMate which allows you to try
all dialogs of full version of CluedoMate. CluedoMate demo has only one
restriction - it doesn't do automatic inferences.
