Hi. My name is Victor Denisov. I'm a software engeneer. I'm passionate about
programming and about languages that help you write correct source code. I'm
writing in Haskell, C, C++, Java. I use python and bash for auxiliary tasks,
but avoid using the languages of their kind in bigger projects.

During my university years (2003 - 2008) I participated in ACM ICPC and TopCoder
contests.
