Hi, my name is Victor Denisov. I'm a software engineer. I'm passionate about
programming and about everything that helps building great software -
development methodologies, writing, code challenges, collaboration. I like
languages that help writing correct programs. I'm writing in Haskell, C, C++,
Java. I also like golang and I'm mastering it at the moment. I use python and bash for
auxiliary tasks, but avoid using the languages of their kind in bigger projects
because of their lack of support for static typing.

During my years at Saratov State University (2003 - 2008) I participated in ACM ICPC and TopCoder
contests.
