<div class="entry-content"><h2>Two Ways to Structure Things</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to understanding that most people organize things like if they were
disassembling a car: 5 inch screws in one pile, 3 inch screws into another
pile, nuts in a third pile, etc. This is the approach that comes first to our
mind when we need to organize something. However it&rsquo;s not the easiest way to
make sense of the whole system if it&rsquo;s structured this way. The whole system
looks like several boxes with nuts and screws of different shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>Another way to do it is by structuring the whole system as interacting
entities. Screws and nuts from engine go into one box. Parts for suspensions
system and wheels go into another box. This way we see functioning elements
instead of piles of smaller parts.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss each of the approaches in details below and with some examples.
In this context let&rsquo;s think about the whole system and several entities standing
side by side or as a tree of objects. A good example would be a row of people.
The first approach I call horizontal, the second - vertical.</p>

<h2>Horizontal Slicing</h2>

<p>The first approach thinks about this row of people as several buckets: one
bucket with heads, one bucket with hands, one bucket with bodies, one bucket
with legs, and one bucket with feet. Not only imagining it is unpleasing it&rsquo;s
also disfunctional. Parts in each of those buckets have very little, so called,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)">cohesion</a>. They
don&rsquo;t interact with each other. They are useless. They just lie in those piles.</p>

<p>This obviously preposterous structuring in this context finds surprisingly wide
support in software engineering. People create a separate package for
exceptions, a separate package for utility classes, etc. Also instead of
sealing logic inside of one class it gets spread among several classes. This
approach leaves little room for encapsulation. Classes and packages have to
make every its member public, because everyone outside this package or class
needs to interact with their members. Setters and getters are considered the
summit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)">encapsulation</a>
in such an environment.</p>

<p>The only argument in favour of this approach is that it&rsquo;s obvious how to use
it. It may have place if these moving parts are already in a relatively small
box. One box for engine and then smaller boxes inside this one for engine&rsquo;s
screws and nuts.</p>

<h2>Vertical Slicing</h2>

<p>The other approach I would call vertical slicing. Vertical because it thinks
about a row of humans as several buckets - human one, human two, human three.
These bodies can&rsquo;t interact with each other by any means other than defined by
public interfaces for these bodies. The liver of one body doesn&rsquo;t interact with
the heart of another body.</p>

<p>Thinking about your classes and packages as living creatures rather than
a buckets for screws and nuts helps a lot with encapsulation of the classes.
The internal state of those classes can be hidden by conventional java&rsquo;s
access control modifiers.</p>

<p>If all the moving parts of one entity are colocated in the same package it&rsquo;s
easier to find them as you are reading the code.</p>

<p>Each package or class in this approach should be as a small library that
provides functions and has a public interface. When I&rsquo;m writing code using this
approach I&rsquo;m asking myself whether I can extract this package into a library
right now. Once I actually need to extract a library from the project is easy
to do so.</p>

<h2>Other Areas</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that this idea is also applicable in other areas of software
engineering. Scrum advocates for vertical slicing of teams. Scrum teams are
supposed to be cross functional and cut through all layers of the product, so,
that one team can deliver any functionality. It&rsquo;s also a popular tendency to
slice teams horizontally. It leads to enormous amount of dependencies between
teams and chaos when delivering a feature that has parts in each of the layers.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of examples when the choice between these two
approaches is not particularly obvious, but very important.</p>

<h3>AST Translation</h3>

<p>A perfect case when people get easily confused how to group classes in packages
is translation of an AST. If you have an application and different parts of
it need to translate this tree into different things then you naturally get
an interface for Visitor for this AST. The tendency to put alike with alike
leads to a confusion. Should implementations of the Visitor interface be stored
near AST definition or near the services that use these implementations.</p>

<p>When this question arises I&rsquo;m thinking about the dependencies that each class
has on other classes as lines between classes.
When we move classes from package to package we want to minimise the number of lines
crossing the boundary of packages.</p>

<p>Three dependencies go through the boundary.
<img src="/images/two_ways/in_package_a.png"></p>

<p>Two dependencies go through the boundary.
<img src="/images/two_ways/in_package_b.png"></p>

<p>In this particular case thinking about this AST tree as a library helps a lot.
The interface Visitor should be stored near the AST tree structures in a
separate package and the implementations of this Visitor interface should be
stored where they are used. It also minimizes the number of dependencies going
through the boundary.</p>

<h3>Configuration Beans in Spring</h3>

<p>Engineers also tend to put all bean declarations in one configuration bean at
the top level of their applications. Here I can say that if the classes inside
the package don&rsquo;t rely on IOC container then it&rsquo;s a perfectly normal practice,
because they don&rsquo;t depend on the defined beans and the main application considers
these classes as plain java objects.</p>

<p>However if the classes inside the package expect some IOC container to be in
place then it makes sense to put another configuration class inside the package
because it helps with understanding how classes will be wired together.</p>

<p>After writing this post I google on this topic and found surprisingly many
similar posts:</p>
